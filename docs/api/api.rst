Model
=====
Model is a sample, a background and a resolution.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   model

Sample
======
Sample is build from assemblies.

.. toctree::   
   :maxdepth: 1
   
   sample

Assemblies
==========
Assemblies are collections of layers that are used to represent a specific physical setup.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   
   assemblies/multilayer
   assemblies/repeating_multilayer
   assemblies/surfactant_layer
   assemblies/gradient_layer

Elements
========
Elements are the building blocks that are required to construct a sample.

Layers
------
Layers are basic elements and used to represent a single layer of material with a thickness and a roughness.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   
   elements/layer
   elements/layer_area_per_molecule

Materials
---------
Materials are the most basic elements and are used to represent a material with given physical properties.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   
   elements/material
   elements/material_density
   elements/material_mixture
   elements/material_solvated
