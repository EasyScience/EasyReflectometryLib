Calculators & Optimisation
==========================

:py:mod:`EasyReflectometry` is built on the :py:mod:`easyScience` framework which facilities the use of a range of different reflectometry calculation engines and optimiser solutions. 
Currently, :py:mod:`EasyReflectometry` can offer two different calculation engines, namely:

* `refnx`_
* `Refl1D`_

And we are working to add more, in particular `bornagain`_ and `GenX`_.
